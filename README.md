Virtualbeep
================

A super simple code snipped I made wih scikit's audiolab to play custom 
frequencies on my speaker. 

Lately, there has been some oddities with the beep command under ubuntu based
distros (some blacklisting issues with the kernel IIRC) and some laptops
don't even support with the hardware. Since I had some funny beep-powered 
shellscripts from past projects (looking at you GIDA) and I didn't have a 
way to play them I decided to make this snippet. 


HOW TO USE?
===============

I'm not managing dependencies so you might want to pip install numpy and
scikits.audiolab.

If you have those packages, clone or download this repo and run virtualbeep.py.
